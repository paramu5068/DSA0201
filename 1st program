1. Perform basic Image Handling and processing operations on the image.
• Read an image in python and Convert an Image to Grayscale

STEPS:
1. Install necessary libraries:
!pip install opencv-python-headless matplotlib

2. Upload an image to Colab:
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

3. Read the image:
Once the image is uploaded, you can read it using OpenCV (cv2) or PIL (Pillow). Here’s how you do it with OpenCV:

import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Load the image
image_path = next(iter(uploaded))  # Get the uploaded image name
image = cv2.imread(image_path)
# OpenCV loads images in BGR format, so convert to RGB for displaying
image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
# Display the original image
plt.imshow(image_rgb)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

4. Convert the image to Grayscale:
To convert the image to grayscale, you can use OpenCV’s cvtColor function:

# Convert the image to grayscale
image_gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
# Display the grayscale image
plt.imshow(image_gray, cmap='gray')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

5. Optional: Save the grayscale image (if needed):
You can save the grayscale image using OpenCV as well:

cv2.imwrite('grayscale_image.jpg', image_gray)
